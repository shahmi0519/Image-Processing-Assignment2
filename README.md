# 🧠 Image Processing Assignment 2

This repository contains implementations of fundamental image processing techniques as part of an academic assignment. The code is written in **Python** using **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, and is provided in a Jupyter Notebook.

---

## 📌 Features

✅ **Add Gaussian Noise**  
Simulate real-world noise by adding Gaussian-distributed noise to the image.

✅ **Otsu’s Thresholding**  
Implement Otsu’s method for automatic image thresholding and compare with OpenCV’s built-in function.

✅ **Region Growing Segmentation**  
Apply a custom region-growing algorithm starting from user-defined seed points.
